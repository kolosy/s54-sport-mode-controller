# S54 Sport mode controller
This is a sport mode controller for the S54 Z3 M. It works by pulling a line to the DME to ground for 1 second, and then keeping track of state and turning on the dash light. This only works on the S54 engined Z3 M, as the functoinality exists in the DME but isn't broken out by default. You will need to add the dash light, and the missing pin housing to the DME connector to make this work.

The housing STLs were made with OnShape, and are available as CAD files here:
